Investment value will change based on the level of activity (number of commits, insertions, and deletions) that the repository has. Some features of the project include a "My Investment" page that lists all of the user's current investments, a page that allows users to search for open source projects to invest in, and a progress page that shows how the investments are doing. Statistics for the number of commits will be shown on a graph.
